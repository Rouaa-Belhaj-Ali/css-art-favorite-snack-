Artistic HTML & CSS Dabbling: A Mosaic of My Favorite Snacks

Welcome to my repository, where the canvas of the web becomes the palette for my snack-inspired art. Here, HTML and CSS are more than just code; they are the brush and paint for creating mosaic masterpieces dedicated to the ever-changing landscape of my favorite snacksðŸ˜….
 Project Overview

 As my snack preferences change, so too will the content of this repository, transforming it into a dynamic piece of art that reflects my palate's journey.

 The Inspiration

At its core, this repository is inspired by the concept of an artistic mosaicâ€”each piece contributing to a larger picture. Each snack, with its unique flavor and texture, adds a new dimension to this digital canvas, creating a composite image that is both diverse and unified in its purpose.

As of now, the spotlight falls on French-fries, celebrated through a blend of vibrant animationsy. 
This current iteration is a homage to the intricate dance of flavors that captivate my senses.
